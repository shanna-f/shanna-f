## 📂 Featured Projects

📑 **SmartSave Team Case Study** 
This 6-week global team project, hosted by The Business Analysis Circle, brought together 7 business analysts across multiple countries. Our goal was to design the business and functional requirements for SmartSave, a mobile/web app that helps young professionals manage spending, set budgets, and save automatically with AI-driven insights. The app addresses common financial challenges like inconsistent saving, overspending, and lack of accessible tools by offering a secure, user-friendly solution.
